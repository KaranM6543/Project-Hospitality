                                                                         **Project Description**

                                                                         
In this project, I have developed an interactive dashboard to analyze key metrics within the hotel industry. The dashboard provides insights into essential performance indicators, enabling more informed decision-making and optimizing pricing and revenue strategies.

**The key metrics tracked in the dashboard are:**

  •	Revenue: Total income generated by the hotel, serving as a primary indicator of financial performance.
  •	Occupancy %: The percentage of available rooms that are booked, reflecting the hotel’s ability to attract guests.
  •	RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): A crucial metric that combines both occupancy and average daily rate (ADR) to measure the hotel's ability to generate revenue from its available 
    rooms.
  •	ADR (Average Daily Rate): The average rate charged per occupied room, helping to assess the pricing strategy and revenue potential.
  •	Realization: This metric is calculated as URN (Utilized Room Nights) / BRN (Booked Room Nights). It measures the proportion of booked room nights that were actually utilized, 
    offering insight into booking efficiency and potential gaps in room occupancy.
    
Additionally, I have created custom measures that calculate the week-on-week change in these key metrics, allowing users to quickly assess the percentage change in performance from one week to the next. This dynamic feature provides a clear view of trends and helps identify areas of improvement or success over time.
With the interactive nature of the dashboard, users can easily filter data, drill down into specific time periods, and compare performance across different weeks or months. This enables real-time monitoring of hotel performance and aids in making data-driven decisions to optimize revenue, improve occupancy, and fine-tune pricing strategies.


**Key Features:**

   •	Interactive Filters: Users can filter by Week, Month, City, and Rooms to dive deeper into specific performance details.
   •	Visualized Key Metrics: The dashboard visually displays Revenue, Occupancy %, ADR, RevPAR, and Realization for easy comparison and trend analysis.
   •	Week-on-Week Analysis: Displays percentage changes for each metric, making it easier to identify performance fluctuations.
   •	Customizable Views: Allows users to tailor the dashboard to their needs, such as focusing on specific timeframes or metrics for a deeper analysis.
   
This dashboard empowers hotel managers and decision-makers to make informed, data-backed decisions that can directly impact profitability and operational efficiency.


**Objective of the Project:**

The goal of this project was to create a comprehensive, real-time tool that provides insights into the hotel’s performance, enabling management to optimize pricing, improve occupancy, and maximize revenue. By tracking key metrics and utilizing week-on-week comparisons, the dashboard offers actionable insights that can drive strategy and performance improvements.

                                                 
                                                 
                                                                                                 
                                                 
                                                 
                                                 
                                                 
                                                 
                                                 
                                                 ***Analysis and Recommendation for Pricing Strategy to Maximize Profit:***
                                                 

Based on the analysis of key metrics and performance data, I recommend the hotel adopt a dynamic pricing strategy with differentiated rates for weekdays and weekends, along with seasonal adjustments to maximize profitability. Below are the key insights and recommendations:

**Current Pricing Strategy: Fixed Pricing**

  •	The hotel currently uses a fixed pricing model, with a constant Average Daily Rate (ADR) across all weeks.
  •	Fixed pricing does not account for fluctuations in demand, which is critical in the competitive hotel industry.


**Importance of Dynamic Pricing**

  •	Dynamic pricing allows hotels to adjust rates based on real-time factors such as occupancy, demand, and market conditions.
  •	By implementing dynamic pricing, the hotel can capture more revenue, especially during peak demand periods like weekends and holiday seasons.

**Weekday vs. Weekend Demand**

  •	Weekend occupancy is generally higher, as guests tend to travel for leisure and social events.
  •	To maximize revenue, rates should be higher on weekends when demand is at its peak.

**Recommendation: Implement Dynamic Pricing**

  •	Weekend Pricing: Increase rates on weekends when demand is higher. This will help the hotel capture additional revenue from guests willing to pay more for weekend stays.
  •	Weekday Pricing: Lower rates on weekdays to attract business travelers or budget-conscious guests, ensuring higher occupancy during off-peak times.
  •	Seasonal Adjustments: During peak seasons (e.g., holidays, summer months, or major local events), the hotel should increase rates to reflect the higher demand. This is an opportunity 
    to maximize revenue during times when guest interest is highest.

**Real-Time Pricing Adjustments**

  •	Prices should be adjusted in real-time based on occupancy levels, local events, or changes in demand. The ability to increase rates during peak periods and adjust for lower demand 
    will optimize profitability.

**Expected Benefits of Dynamic Pricing**

  •	Increased Revenue: Aligning prices with demand—especially during weekends and peak seasons—will lead to higher revenue.
  •	Optimized Occupancy: Lowering weekday rates can help fill rooms during off-peak times, increasing overall occupancy.
  •	Improved Competitiveness: A dynamic pricing model allows the hotel to remain competitive by adjusting rates according to market trends and guest behavior.

**Conclusion: Adopting Dynamic Pricing**

  •	I recommend implementing dynamic pricing with weekend and weekday rate differentiation, as well as seasonal price adjustments.
  •	This strategy will allow the hotel to capitalize on demand fluctuations, improve occupancy, and maximize profitability.
